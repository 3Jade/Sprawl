	* @brief   Reset a buffer back to its original state.
	*          Does NOT reset the read and write positions, those are done by the functions below.
	*
	* @details The way this works is like this:
	*          When a buffer has been completely used up, rather than freeing it, it's marked for reuse later.
	*          The reason for this is that freeing it isn't safe - it may still be accessed after or while it's
	*          being freed. Instead, this algorithm takes used blocks and moves them to the end of the block list
	*          to be used again later. When we start to write it again, we set the write position back to the start,
	*          and likewise, when we start to read it again, we set the read position back to the start.
	*
	*          This is safe even though it may be read again because the read and write positions aren't set.
	*          When the read and write positions are obtained, one of two results can occur:
	*          1) It will get a value that's past the end of the buffer and go to retrieve (or allocate) the next buffer
	*          2) It will read it while or after the write/read position is reset, in which case this buffer is already ready
	*          for use again and it gets a valid item that it's absolutely permitted to continue operating on.
	*
	*          Either of these situations is fine, meaning that using this queue after it's been put on the back is never
	*          a problem.

/**
* class    sprawl::collections::ConcurrentQueue
*
* @brief   Concurrent queue, supporting multi-consumer, multi-producer access
*          from multiple threads with no synchronization required. Unbounded, capable of
*          resizing itself when it's out of space.
*
* @details Strictly speaking, this is not a lock-free queue. When it needs to allocate,
*          it does acquire a spin lock. It also does this when it needs to fetch a new
*          read queue because the current one is exhausted.
*
*          However, while it's not STRICTLY speaking lock-free, PRACTICALLY speaking,
*          it's wait-free population agnostic for the vast majority of enqueues and dequeues.
*          So long as the reservation ticket used for dequeues is kept alive, this queue is extremely fast.
*          Be warned, however, that if you don't keep the reservation ticket alive, the queue will still work,
*          but dequeues will be somewhat slower - while the ticket stays alive, it batches reference counting
*          operations, but each time the reservation ticket destructs it has to apply those reference count changes.
*          Which means if it destructs after every dequeue, there's an atomic fetch_sub that will happen after each
*          queue. It sounds like it's not a big deal, but removing one fetch_sub operation from each dequeue
*          can have a surprisingly large performance impact.
*
*          Note, though, that the reservation tickets MUST BE KEPT ALIVE if dequeue returns false, or an element
*          in the queue will become unreachable and will never be read, and memory for the buffer containing it
*          will not be able to be reused and will cause a memory leak.
*
* @tparam  t_ElementType       the type of element to store in the queue
*
* @tparam  t_BlockSize         the number of elements to allocate at a time.
*                              Generally speaking, most queues will end up seeing double this number in use,
*                              assuming it's reasonably large and enqueue operations don't outpace dequeue operations.
*                              Once the first block is used up a new one will be allocated and the first will be reused
*                              if it's empty, rather than being freed, hence seeing double this number in memory usage after
*                              the initial t_BlockSize reads have been completed.
*
* @tparam   t_AllocatorType    An allocator class compatible with std::allocator. Does not actually allocate individual elements;
*                              rather, allocates blocks of type detail::Buffer<t_Element, t_BlockSize>, hence this class
*                              must support `rebind`. For ticket-free dequeue operations, ReadReservationTickets will also
*                              be allocated after failed reads, and deallocated on subsequent successful reads.

/**
* @class   sprawl::collections::ConcurrentBoundedQueue
*
* @brief   A bounded implementation of ConcurrentQueue.
*
* @details The core algorithm of this queue is essentially the same algorithm as the
*          unbounded version of this queue - however, there are a few key differences:
*
*          First, and probably most importantly, this queue cannot grow. It works as
*          a circular buffer, and can only hold the specified number of elements at
*          one time. Elements that are read by Dequeue() become available to be
*          written again, but if no consumer threads are running, or producer threads
*          significantly outpace consumer threads, the queue can become full,
*          causing Enqueue() to return false.
*
*          Secondly, unlike the unbounded version, this queue is truly lock-free
*          and wait-free. There are no situations that involve taking a lock.
*
*          Thirdly, reservation tickets are required for both enqueue AND dequeue;
*          however, they only need to be kept alive after a return of false from either
*          method. If the return value is true, the ticket can be safely thrown away.
*
*          Note that there is one situation that can cause an enqueue thread to become
*          blocked: if a dequeue thread gets a return of false and doesn't call Dequeue()
*          again with that ticket, an enqueue thread will be blocked waiting for that
*          spot to be read, even after other enqueue threads successfully move on and continue
*          writing.
*
*          Also note that t_QueueSize will be adjusted up to the nearest power of 2 for performance
*          reasons.
*
* @tparam  t_ElementType       the type of element to store in the queue
*
* @tparam  t_QueueSize         the maximum number of elements that can be in the queue at a time.
*                              Once this number has been reached, enqueue() operations will fail until
*                              elements have been dequeued. This is not a maximum number of elements
*                              ever inserted, only a maximum number that can be held unread at a time -
*                              representing overhead between enqueue and dequeue operations.
*
* @tparam  t_AllocatorType     Allocator used to allocate tickets for the ticket-free enqueue
*                              and dequeue operations. The allocators are NOT used in the operations
*                              that do accept ticket parameters; those are alloc-free.

	* @brief   Attempt to dequeue an item without passing in any tickets.
	*
	* @details This version of Dequeue() does not require persistent tickets even on a return value of false
	*          (or any tickets, for that matter). The performance of the common case will be similar to the other
	*          version of Dequeue(). In the case of failed reads, performance will be somewhat hampered,
	*          but still superior to the performance of a successful read.
	*
	*
	* @param   val      A reference to a value, which will be filled with the contents of the dequeued element, if any.
	*                   The move assignment operator will be called on the value, if one exists.
	*
	* @return  true if the dequeue succeeded and tha value holds a valid item, false if the dequeue failed.
